Basic understanding of what is supposed to happen when I load the web page :
1. Once I press the Generate Password button I should recieve a PROMPT asking me to choose the length of the password (between 8-50 characters) (Also is this a function?)
2. IF I click cancel and and recieve a false value, I should receive an ALERT stating that I must decide on a length
3. ELSE IF will check the argument of the characters being between 8-50. So if that is false, I should recieve an ALERT saying that the range must be between 8 and 50 characters.
4. ELSE? ELSE IF? Not sure yet. But the next step of this IF statement will be the 4 CONFIRMS. They will ask if you want uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and/or special characters. 
5. IF all of those variables are false, I should recieve an ALERT that I have to choose some sort of character for the button to work.
6. Then I think there will be a bunch of ELSE IF statements that work through each possible combo of user preferences. Like each ELSE IF statement can use && to check if multiple arguments are true. If they are true, then I can use .concat to add different variables together as a string back inside of the user variables (I think thats the right way to think through that.)
7. All of that user preference data then has to go into another variable for the password itself. Like we have to make another storage section. I believe this will require a FOR LOOP and the math.random to make random decisions from the previous ELSE IF statements. 
8. I remember that using .push can add data back into a variable, so that will probably be how the final data gets added into the box on the screen.
9. Ideally I'll figure out how to make it automatically copy to the clipboard.
