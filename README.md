# HW-3-PWGen
This is a homework assignment with the task of using JS to make a random password generator. 

HOW IT WORKS:
When you click the generate button, it will ask you a series of questions. The first will be a prompt that asks for the length of your password. Then you can use 'OK' to confirm a type of character you would like or 'Cancel' to not use that type of character. 
Once you have made a valid decision for each prompt and alert, your password will be displayed in the box above the button. 


THOUGHTS ON THE PROCESS
I still had an incredibly difficult time getting this started and don't feel like I'm getting JS as quick as others in the class. Organizing what goes inside of what has been a challenge and it took a lot of youtube videos to make it finally click that conditional statements can go inside of a function and then the function can be run on a loop or put inside of yet another variable that can be linked to an id in the HTML. That line of thought took me forFreakingEver. I had to revist class videos and use codecadamy lessons as a reference for the concepts we have covered so far. I'm honestly suprised I got anything to work because I don't think I worked on this in an order that that's beneficial to working clean. For instance, I wrote out the bulk IF ELSE statement on a seperate JS file before thinking that it could go inside a function. I just knew that the line of thought had to happen somewhere in the file.


I started by trying to write out on paper what I thought the different variables would be. Then I wrote down all the different combos that could come from that. i.e. confirmLower && confirmUpper && confirmSpec
Doing this made it clear to me that using pen and paper will still be a vital part of my coding experience. I have a hard time visualizing the order of it all on the computer, especially starting from a blank page. 

I feel like my current logic involves the least amount of math arithmitic which is probably why it's such a large file. I couldn't think of how else to check each condition other than writing out each combo on paper and then use && to check those arguments over and over again.

These pages were a huge part of making my logic work.
